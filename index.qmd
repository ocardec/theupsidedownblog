In a world where success is defined by power, prestige, and self-promotion, The Upside-Down kingdom blog, invites you to discover the freedom and joy found in surrendering to the paradoxical ways of Jesus. I pray for you to gain insight and enlightenment throughout these seemly contradictory, but ordered statements and graphics.

Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God." â€“ [John 3:5](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/JHN.3.5){target="_blank"}
