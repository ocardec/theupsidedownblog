## Unless One is Born Again: The Upside-Down Kingdom Application – A Reflection on John 3:3

![](../../img/reborn.webp){fig-align="center" width="350"}

In John 3:3, Jesus says to Nicodemus, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.” This statement not only startled Nicodemus but continues to challenge the world's understanding of life, identity, and purpose. Jesus declares that entry into God’s kingdom requires more than human effort, moral behavior, or even religious knowledge. Instead, it requires a radical transformation—a new birth.

#### The World’s Perspective vs. the Kingdom’s Perspective

From the world's perspective, change is often seen as a process of self-improvement or personal development. The world tells us that we can reinvent ourselves, set goals, and achieve success by our own efforts. People believe that they can shape their destiny, find fulfillment, and reach the pinnacle of success through education, career, status, and wealth. Many see religion as a way to improve oneself morally or gain approval through good deeds and righteous living.

However, in the upside-down kingdom, Jesus teaches that no amount of self-effort or external transformation is sufficient to enter God’s kingdom. It’s not about becoming a better version of ourselves or achieving outward success—it’s about being born again, a complete spiritual rebirth that only comes through the Spirit of God. This goes against the world’s understanding of merit, performance, and self-reliance. The world says, “Try harder, do better, and you’ll make it.” The kingdom says, “You must be completely remade.”

#### The Upside-Down Kingdom’s Perspective

In the upside-down kingdom, the concept of being "born again" points to a profound spiritual transformation—a regeneration that cannot be accomplished by human strength or effort. Jesus teaches that this new birth is the work of the Holy Spirit, a divine renewal that changes the very nature of a person. This rebirth is necessary to enter God’s kingdom because, in the kingdom of God, life is not built on human effort but on spiritual transformation.

Here are the key elements of the upside-down kingdom’s perspective on being born again:

-   **A New Identity in Christ:** When someone is born again, they become a new creation in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17). Their old life, driven by worldly desires and self-interest, is put to death, and they are given a new identity as a child of God. In the world, identity is often rooted in achievements, background, or status, but in the kingdom, identity comes from being born into God’s family.
-   **Spiritual Life Over Fleshly Life:** The world focuses on outward success, appearance, and accomplishments, but the upside-down kingdom focuses on inner spiritual life. Jesus explains that flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit (John 3:6). Being born again means living according to the Spirit, not according to worldly desires or human will.
-   **Dependence on God’s Grace:** In the upside-down kingdom, entrance into life with God is not something we can earn or achieve—it is a gift of grace. Being born again is entirely God’s work, and it is through His mercy and love that we are transformed. This challenges the world’s belief that success is based on human effort and performance.
-   **Transformation of the Heart:** Being born again means experiencing a transformation of the heart. The heart of stone is replaced with a heart of flesh (Ezekiel 36:26). In the world, change is often surface-level, focusing on behavior or habits. But in God’s kingdom, true change happens from the inside out as the Holy Spirit renews and transforms our desires, thoughts, and actions.

#### Living Out the Principle

To live out the principle of being born again in the upside-down kingdom means embracing a life that is radically different from the world’s values and priorities. Here’s how:

-   **Embrace Your New Identity in Christ:** When you are born again, your identity is no longer rooted in what the world says about you—whether in terms of success, appearance, or social standing. Instead, your identity is rooted in Christ and what He has done for you. Living out this new identity means rejecting the pressure to conform to worldly standards and finding your worth and value in being a child of God.
-   **Walk by the Spirit, Not the Flesh:** Being born again means living according to the Spirit’s guidance and power, not according to the desires of the flesh. This involves daily dependence on the Holy Spirit for wisdom, strength, and direction. It means cultivating spiritual disciplines like prayer, Bible reading, and fellowship, allowing God to continually renew and transform your heart.
-   **Depend on Grace, Not Performance:** In the upside-down kingdom, success is not measured by human performance but by God’s grace. Living out this principle means resting in God’s finished work through Christ, knowing that your place in His kingdom is not earned by works but by faith in Jesus. It also means extending grace to others, knowing that transformation is God’s work in them, just as it is in you.
-   **Live with an Eternal Perspective:** Being born again opens your eyes to the reality of God’s kingdom, which is eternal. This new perspective changes how you view your life on earth—it’s no longer about accumulating wealth, power, or success but about investing in what will last forever. Living with this eternal perspective means prioritizing God’s will, seeking first His kingdom, and living for things that have eternal significance.

#### The Invitation to Practice

The invitation of John 3:3 is both simple and profound: **Will you choose to be born again and live as a citizen of the upside-down kingdom?**

Jesus offers this invitation to all who are willing to let go of their old ways of living and embrace a new life in Him. It is a call to surrender, to receive the gift of new birth, and to walk in the Spirit. This new birth is not something we can achieve by our own efforts—it is a gift of grace. It is a call to die to the old self and be raised to new life in Christ.

If you have not yet experienced the new birth, the invitation is open to you today: Believe in Jesus Christ, and receive the transforming power of His Spirit. If you have already been born again, then live out your new identity with boldness and joy, walking by the Spirit and rejecting the world’s call to live by the flesh.

The upside-down kingdom calls us to see life not as a series of self-improvements but as a radical transformation made possible by God’s grace. This transformation starts with being born again—a rebirth that changes everything.

Will you respond to the call of the upside-down kingdom? The choice is yours. Let the Spirit of God renew your heart, and live as a new creation, empowered by His grace and walking in His truth.
