## His Rejection, Our Salvation: The Upside-Down Kingdom Application – A Reflection on John 1:10-12

![](../../img/thelight.webp){fig-align="center" width="350"}

In the Gospel of John, we find a profound and poignant statement about Christ's earthly ministry: “He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, yet the world did not know Him. He came to His own, and His own people did not receive Him” (John 1:10-11). This rejection of Jesus by the very people He came to save is a crucial reflection of the "upside-down kingdom"—a kingdom where God's ways defy human expectations, and His purposes overturn worldly values.

### The King Rejected

The world did not recognize its Creator. The very One through whom all things were made was met with ignorance and indifference. More striking still, "His own people," Israel, who had been given the law, the prophets, and the promises of God, did not receive Him. Instead of being welcomed as their long-awaited Messiah, He was despised and rejected (Isaiah 53:3). In the kingdoms of this world, a king demands loyalty, exerts power, and punishes those who reject him. Yet, in God's upside-down kingdom, King Jesus allows Himself to be rejected and humiliated, ultimately to serve and save those who scorn Him.

### Rejection as the Path to Salvation

The rejection of Christ is not a failure in God’s plan, but its very foundation. It was through rejection that Christ accomplished the work of salvation. He came not to establish a throne on earth through force or political power but to lay down His life for sinners. As the Apostle Peter declares, "This Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men" (Acts 2:23). In this, we see the paradox of the cross: Jesus' rejection and death became the means by which He would save His people.

The cross, a symbol of shame and defeat in the world's eyes, is the instrument of victory in the kingdom of God. “He came to His own, and His own people did not receive Him. But to all who did receive Him, who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God” (John 1:11-12). This is the upside-down kingdom: the rejected King grants the rebels the privilege of becoming sons and daughters of God, not by merit, but by grace alone through faith in Him.

### The Call to Follow the Rejected King

The upside-down kingdom challenges our natural inclinations and cultural expectations. We are called to follow a King who was rejected, mocked, and crucified. This requires a reorientation of our lives. Jesus Himself said, “If anyone would come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me” (Matthew 16:24). To follow Christ is to embrace His rejection by the world and to recognize that in Him, our true worth and citizenship are not found in worldly success or acceptance, but in being loved and chosen by God.

In the upside-down kingdom, rejection is not the end; it is the beginning of true life. The path to glory is through humility; the way to greatness is through service. Christ's rejection shows us that God’s power is made perfect in weakness (2 Corinthians 12:9). As we share in His rejection, we are also assured of sharing in His resurrection and glory.

### Conclusion: Embracing the Paradox

The upside-down kingdom of God invites us to a radical rethinking of what it means to belong, to be loved, and to be great. Jesus was rejected by the very people He came to save, yet in that rejection, He opened the way for us to become children of God. His rejection was our salvation. In His kingdom, those who are last will be first, the humble will be exalted, and the rejected will find a home in Him. Let us, therefore, embrace the paradox, follow the rejected King, and find in His rejection our eternal acceptance.
