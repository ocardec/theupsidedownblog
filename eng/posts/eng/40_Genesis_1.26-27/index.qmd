## **Imprinted with God's Image: Living the Paradox of Identity**

![](/eng/posts/img/imprint.webp){fig-align="center" width="400"}

### **The World vs. the Kingdom’s Perspective**

In our modern world, identity is a contested battlefield. Society tells us we are defined by our achievements, our possessions, our personal expression, or even our struggles. The world’s perspective says: *You are what you do. You are what you own. You are what you feel.* This identity framework is constantly shifting, creating an exhausting cycle of self-definition and self-validation. People search endlessly for meaning—whether in career success, social status, or personal reinvention—yet they are left empty, longing for something more enduring.

The Kingdom of God, however, tells a different story. From the very beginning, Scripture declares that humanity is made in the image of God (Genesis 1:26-27). This means our worth is not earned or self-determined; it is *bestowed*. Unlike the world’s unstable identity markers, the imago Dei is an unchanging, divinely given reality. Our identity is not rooted in human effort but in divine creation. Paradoxically, though we bear God's image, we often live as though we do not, forgetting the mark of our Creator upon us and embracing lesser identities.

### **The Paradox Explained**

Here lies the paradox: We are made in God's image, yet we forget, reject, or fail to live in the light of this truth. We are designed for divine glory, yet we chase after earthly significance. Even though we inherently carry God’s imprint, we often do not acknowledge it, and in doing so, we forfeit the ability to reflect His virtues to the world.

Jesus alluded to this paradox when He responded to the Pharisees regarding paying taxes: *“Whose image is this? And whose inscription?” “Caesar’s,” they answered. Then Jesus told them, “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s”* (Mark 12:16-17). The implication is profound. If a coin bearing Caesar’s image belongs to Caesar, then what of us—who bear the image of God? We belong to Him. Our lives are not our own; they are to be given back to God in full surrender. Yet, instead of yielding to God, we often live as though our lives belong to ourselves.

This paradox is further reflected in the concept of the *true self*. As Kathy Keary notes, our soul carries the divine imprint, yet we struggle to rediscover and reclaim it[^1]. Richard Rohr similarly speaks of an inner blueprint, a divine DNA calling to be fulfilled[^2]. And as Pastor Daniel Jarvis emphasizes, our identity in God should drive us to love others, stand against injustice, and reflect Christ’s character[^3]. However, the reality is that many—even believers—live unaware of or disconnected from this truth.

This is the great contradiction of our existence: We are bearers of the divine image, yet we live as though we are lost, self-made, or undefined. The world tells us to construct our own identity, while God tells us our identity has already been given. The world tells us to seek validation externally, while God tells us we are already validated in Him. The world tells us to look inward for answers, while God tells us to look upward.

### **Living the Paradox and Acting Accordingly**

If we are to truly live in light of the imago Dei, we must act according to the paradox, embracing the upside-down reality of God’s Kingdom. This means:

1.  **Recognizing that identity is received, not created.** Instead of striving to craft an identity based on worldly success, personal achievements, or self-determined definitions, we must rest in the truth that our identity is *bestowed* by God. We do not define ourselves—God has already done that. To live this paradox means surrendering the world’s narrative of self-construction and embracing God’s unchanging decree: *You are Mine.*

2.  **Returning ourselves fully to God.** Just as Jesus commanded that what bears Caesar’s image should be returned to Caesar, we must return to God what bears *His* image—ourselves. This means a life of worship, obedience, and surrender. It means aligning our actions, desires, and purpose with His will, not our own. It is a call to live *for* God rather than for self.

3.  **Reflecting God's image in a broken world.** As image-bearers, we are called to reflect God’s character—His love, justice, holiness, and mercy—to a world that desperately needs Him. This means loving sacrificially, advocating for the voiceless, standing for truth, and living with integrity. In a culture that distorts and diminishes the image of God, we must reclaim it in the way we treat others and in how we uphold the dignity of every human life.

4.  **Resisting cultural narratives that contradict God's truth.** The world pressures us to conform to its ever-changing definitions of identity, worth, and purpose. Yet Scripture calls us to be transformed by the renewal of our minds (Romans 12:2). Living the paradox means rejecting cultural lies and clinging to God’s eternal truth, no matter how countercultural it may seem.

5.  **Living with a Kingdom mindset.** The upside-down Kingdom teaches that true greatness comes through servanthood, that life is found in dying to self, and that the last shall be first. When we embrace our identity as image-bearers, we live not for earthly success but for eternal significance. We value what God values, pursue what He pursues, and seek first His Kingdom (Matthew 6:33).

### **Conclusion**

The paradox of the imago Dei is both a mystery and a calling. Though we bear God's image, we must actively live in its reality. Our identity is not found in what we do, feel, or achieve, but in who we are in Christ. To live this paradox is to return ourselves to God, reflecting His glory in a world that has forgotten Him. It is to embrace the upside-down truth of the Kingdom: that in losing ourselves in Him, we find who we truly are.
