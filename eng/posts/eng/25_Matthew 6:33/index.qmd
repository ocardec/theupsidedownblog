## The Kingdom First: The Upside-Down Kingdom Application – A Reflection on Matthew 6:19-21

![](../../img/kingdomfirst.webp){fig-align="center" width="350"}

In Matthew 6:33, Jesus declares, “But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.” This verse is the climax of His teaching on anxiety and worldly concerns. It encapsulates a central tenet of what it means to live in the “upside-down kingdom” — a kingdom where God's rule and righteousness take precedence over every earthly pursuit.

#### The Radical Call to Prioritize God’s Kingdom

In the upside-down kingdom, Jesus calls His followers to radically reorder their priorities. The world teaches us to prioritize self-preservation, security, and material gain. We are told to seek after comfort, status, and success, believing these will fulfill us. However, Jesus flips this thinking on its head by urging His followers to seek God's kingdom first.

To “seek” the kingdom is to actively pursue God's rule and reign in every aspect of our lives. It means we strive to live according to His righteousness, not our own standards or the standards of this world. This pursuit is not passive; it requires deliberate choices, daily surrender, and an earnest desire to see God glorified above all else.

#### What Does “Seeking First” Look Like?

In practical terms, seeking first the kingdom means aligning our goals, desires, and decisions with God’s purposes. It means placing obedience to God above personal ambition, choosing integrity over convenience, and valuing eternal treasures over temporary pleasures. Seeking the kingdom first affects how we spend our time, how we use our resources, and how we interact with others. It shifts our focus from self-centered living to God-centered living.

For example, when facing a career decision, the question for a disciple is not “What will make me the most money?” but rather, “What choice will most honor God and advance His kingdom?” When considering how to spend our free time, it’s not merely about what is most entertaining, but what will help us grow in holiness and serve others.

#### The Promise of Provision

Jesus gives a remarkable promise attached to this command: “all these things will be added to you.” What are “all these things”? In the context, they are the basic needs of life — food, drink, clothing — the very things we are tempted to worry about. Jesus assures us that when we prioritize God’s kingdom, our Father, who knows our needs, will provide for us. This does not mean we will have everything we desire, but it does mean that God will meet our true needs according to His wisdom and purpose.

This promise liberates us from the tyranny of materialism and the fear of lack. It frees us to live with open hands, generous hearts, and a trust that God is both sovereign and good. When our hearts are set on God's kingdom, we can release our anxieties and trust that He will take care of what concerns us.

#### The Upside-Down Application

In the upside-down kingdom, we are called to place God's agenda above our own, trusting that He will handle our needs. While the world chases after comfort, security, and wealth, we are called to chase after righteousness, truth, and God’s glory. In doing so, we find that our deepest needs — for purpose, joy, peace, and provision — are met in Him.

This call is countercultural. It challenges us to live against the grain of societal norms and expectations. It requires faith to believe that God’s ways are better than our own and that His promises are trustworthy. But when we take God at His word, we discover the profound truth that our ultimate security is found not in our circumstances but in our Savior.

So, in this upside-down kingdom, we live with the assurance that when we seek the King first, He takes care of everything else. Our lives become a testimony to the sufficiency of God and the beauty of a life surrendered to His will.
