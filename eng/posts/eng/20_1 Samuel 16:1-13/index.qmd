## The Shepherd Boy Becomes the King: The Upside-Down Kingdom Application – A Reflection on 1 Samuel 16:1-13

![](../../img/annointed.webp){fig-align="center" width="350"}

In 1 Samuel 16:1-13, we find the story of David, a young shepherd boy, who is anointed by the prophet Samuel to become the next king of Israel. This narrative illustrates a core principle of the upside-down kingdom: God often chooses the least likely, the overlooked, and the humble to accomplish His greatest purposes.

#### The Story of David: An Unlikely Choice

When Samuel was sent by God to anoint a new king from among the sons of Jesse, he initially assumed that the oldest and strongest son, Eliab, would be the Lord’s chosen. But God corrected Samuel, saying, “Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For the LORD sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart” (1 Samuel 16:7).

All of Jesse's sons passed before Samuel, but none were chosen by God. It wasn’t until the youngest son, David, was called from the fields where he was tending sheep that God revealed His choice. Despite David’s youth and lowly status, God saw in him a heart that sought after Him—a heart that would be willing to follow and serve Him faithfully.

#### The Upside-Down Kingdom’s Perspective: God Chooses the Humble

The story of David’s anointing reflects the radical values of the upside-down kingdom. In the world’s eyes, kings are chosen based on strength, appearance, status, and outward qualifications. But God’s kingdom operates differently. God chooses the humble, the lowly, and the least likely to carry out His purposes. David, the shepherd boy, is a perfect example of how God sees beyond human criteria and values what is often overlooked by others.

This story reminds us that God’s ways are not our ways, and His thoughts are not our thoughts (Isaiah 55:8-9). He delights in using the weak to shame the strong, the foolish to confound the wise, and the humble to lead the proud (1 Corinthians 1:27-29). In God's economy, a shepherd boy can become a king, not because of his own merits, but because of God's sovereign choice and grace.

#### The Upside-Down Kingdom Application: Embracing God's Unexpected Choices

1.  **God Looks at the Heart, Not the Outward Appearance:** In the upside-down kingdom, God values the condition of our hearts more than our outward qualifications or societal status. David was not chosen because he looked like a king, but because he had a heart that was aligned with God’s will. This teaches us to prioritize internal transformation over external appearances, seeking to cultivate hearts that are humble, obedient, and faithful to God.

2.  **God Uses the Lowly and Overlooked:** David’s story demonstrates that God often chooses those who are overlooked by the world. In God’s kingdom, no one is too small, too insignificant, or too weak to be used by Him. The upside-down nature of the kingdom invites us to see ourselves and others not through worldly lenses but through God’s perspective. It challenges us to look beyond appearances and to recognize the potential for God’s work in the least likely places.

3.  **God Equips Those He Calls:** When God chose David, He did not choose him because he was already a warrior or a statesman; He chose him while he was still a shepherd. In God’s kingdom, those He calls, He also equips. David's experiences as a shepherd—defending his flock against lions and bears—prepared him for his future battles as king (1 Samuel 17:34-37). This encourages us to trust that when God calls us, He will also provide the strength, wisdom, and grace we need to fulfill His purposes.

4.  **True Leadership is Rooted in Humility and Service:** David's time as a shepherd was not wasted; it was a season of preparation. Shepherds were known for their care, vigilance, and sacrificial protection of their sheep. These were the qualities God desired in a king for Israel. In the upside-down kingdom, true leadership is not about power or prestige but about servanthood, humility, and faithfulness to God’s calling. Jesus Himself, the ultimate King, came not to be served but to serve (Matthew 20:28).

#### Living Out the Upside-Down Kingdom

To live according to the principles of the upside-down kingdom means embracing God’s unexpected choices and aligning ourselves with His values. It means:

-   **Valuing Humility Over Pride:** Just as David was chosen for his humble heart, we are called to cultivate humility, recognizing our dependence on God and our need for His grace.

-   **Embracing God’s Purposes for Our Lives:** Like David, we must be willing to step into the roles and tasks God assigns us, even when they seem insignificant or mundane. The shepherd boy did not despise his role but was faithful in it, preparing him for the greater tasks to come.

-   **Recognizing the Potential in Others:** The upside-down kingdom challenges us to see others through God’s eyes, recognizing that He often chooses the least likely to accomplish His purposes. This perspective calls us to encourage, support, and uplift those whom the world may overlook.

#### Conclusion: A Shepherd Who Became a King

David’s anointing as king teaches us that God’s ways are often unexpected and that He delights in using the humble to accomplish His divine purposes. In the upside-down kingdom, shepherds become kings, the overlooked are chosen, and those who seem insignificant play crucial roles in God’s redemptive story.

By embracing this truth, we are invited to trust God’s wisdom, seek His will, and live with hearts fully devoted to Him—knowing that in His kingdom, He sees, calls, and equips each one according to His perfect plan.
