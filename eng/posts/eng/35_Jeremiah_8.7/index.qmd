## Missing the Point - A Reflection on Jeremiah 8:7

![](images/stork.webp){fig-align="center" width="613"}

> *“Even the stork in the heavens knows her times, and the turtledove, swallow, and crane keep the time of their coming, but my people know not the rules of the Lord.”* (Jeremiah 8:7, ESV)

The Scriptures highlight a recurring theme of spiritual blindness: people who should have known and understood God’s plans but failed to recognize His presence right before their eyes. Jeremiah’s lament is a profound illustration of this. Nature—God’s creation—instinctively knows and follows the Creator’s rhythms and laws. Yet God’s chosen people missed the essential truths and purposes of the Lord. This theme becomes even more striking in the New Testament, where the religious leaders, despite their deep knowledge of the Law and Prophets, failed to recognize Jesus Christ, the Messiah. In this blog, we will explore the paradox of spiritual blindness: how those most familiar with God’s Word can miss the heart of His message. We will do so in three sections: The World vs. the Kingdom’s Perspective, The Paradox Explained, and Living the Paradox and Acting Accordingly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **The World vs. the Kingdom’s Perspective**

**World’s Perspective:**\
From a worldly perspective, knowledge is power. The world places immense value on the accumulation of information, education, and expertise. In society, those who are knowledgeable, whether in science, law, or theology, are highly esteemed. In religious settings, this emphasis on knowledge often translates to a deep reverence for scholars, theologians, and religious leaders. The scribes and Pharisees in Jesus' day epitomized this mindset. They were experts in the Law, having devoted their lives to studying the Scriptures and meticulously observing religious rituals. They were confident in their understanding and secure in their religious status, believing that their extensive knowledge gave them favor with God.

Even today, we often fall into the same trap. We think that if we know the right doctrines, can quote Scripture, or have attended church faithfully, we must be aligned with God’s purposes. The world’s perspective equates information with spiritual maturity and often elevates religious formality over genuine faith and transformation.

**Kingdom’s Perspective:**\
But the Kingdom of God operates differently. The upside-down Kingdom values a heart that is soft and receptive over a mind that is simply knowledgeable. Jesus said, *“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God”* (Matthew 5:8, ESV). It’s not the one who knows the most about God who is most blessed, but the one who has a heart ready to receive Him. The Pharisees had vast knowledge, but they missed the heart of God. They were experts in the Scriptures, yet they failed to recognize the very One the Scriptures were about. Jesus, the Word made flesh, was in their midst, yet they remained blind to His presence.

Jeremiah captures this reality powerfully: the natural world recognizes and follows the Creator’s appointed rhythms, but God’s people remain blind and deaf to His voice. The irony is striking: the stork, the turtledove, and the swift obey God’s laws of nature, yet humanity, endowed with reason and revelation, fails to perceive God’s plans. In the Kingdom, spiritual sight requires humility, dependence on God, and a heart transformed by grace—not just the accumulation of religious knowledge.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **The Paradox Explained**

The paradox is clear: *those most familiar with God’s Word were the ones who missed God’s presence.* Jesus wept over Jerusalem, expressing His heartbreak that the city, which had seen God’s miracles and heard His prophecies, did not recognize the time of God’s visitation. He lamented, *“Would that you, even you, had known on this day the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes”* (Luke 19:42, ESV). Despite their religious devotion, the people of Jerusalem missed their moment of salvation. The tragedy lay not in a lack of religious practice but in the failure to grasp the essence of God’s visitation.

> " ...you did not know the time of your visitation.”

John 1:11 echoes this heartbreaking reality: *“He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him”*. Jesus didn’t come to strangers; He came to the people who were waiting for a Messiah. They had studied the Law and the Prophets, anticipated God’s deliverance, and adhered to religious practices, yet when God Himself appeared, they rejected Him. Why? Their spiritual eyes were closed. They expected a conquering king, not a humble servant. They were looking for a political liberator, not a suffering Savior. Their expectations blinded them to God’s actual work.

Jesus directly confronted this spiritual blindness when speaking to the religious leaders: *“You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me, yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life”* (John 5:39-40, ESV). Their problem was not a lack of Scripture knowledge but a lack of spiritual perception. They missed the point. They were so focused on the words of the Law that they failed to recognize the Word made flesh.

> *“Would that you, even you, had known on this day the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes”* (Luke 19:42, ESV)

Isaiah 1:3 further illustrates this theme: *“The ox knows its owner, and the donkey its master’s crib, but Israel does not know; my people do not understand”*. Even animals recognize and respond to their master, yet God’s people did not recognize their Creator. It’s a sobering reminder that we, too, can become so caught up in religious practices and theological debates that we fail to encounter the living God.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Living the Paradox and Acting Accordingly**

How do we avoid the trap of spiritual blindness? How do we live in a way that honors the paradox of knowing God not just with our minds but with our hearts and lives? Here are three ways:

1.  **Seek Relationship Over Mere Knowledge**\
    The Pharisees knew the Scriptures but missed Jesus. We must ensure that our pursuit of God isn’t just intellectual. Bible study is essential, but it must lead to deeper intimacy with Christ. Spend time in prayer, asking God to reveal Himself personally. Approach the Word of God not just as a textbook but as a love letter. The goal is not just to learn about Jesus but to meet Him and be changed by Him.

2.  **Stay Humble and Open to God’s Ways**\
    Spiritual pride is one of the greatest barriers to recognizing God’s work. The Pharisees’ certainty in their religious knowledge made them blind to the new thing God was doing. We, too, need to remain humble and teachable. Be willing to let God surprise you. Be open to the possibility that God’s ways may not align with your expectations. As Isaiah 55:8-9 reminds us, *“For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the Lord”*.

3.  **Discern God’s Presence in Everyday Life**\
    Jeremiah’s lament about the birds knowing their seasons reminds us to look for God in the ordinary. Don’t just expect to encounter God in church or through religious activities; look for Him in the rhythms of daily life. See God’s hand in creation, in acts of kindness, in unexpected moments of grace. Jesus often revealed Himself in ordinary, everyday settings—a dinner table, a fishing boat, a walk down the road. We must be attentive to God’s presence, even when it appears in places we least expect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Conclusion**

**Seeing What’s Hidden in Plain Sight**

Spiritual blindness is a danger we all face. The Scriptures are full of warnings about missing God’s work, not because He is absent, but because we are not paying attention. The upside-down Kingdom challenges us to move beyond religious knowledge and into a vibrant, living relationship with Jesus. It calls us to lay down our preconceived notions and embrace the unpredictable, life-changing ways of God.

Jesus is still visiting His people today. The question is: Will we recognize Him, or will we miss the point? Will we have hearts humble enough to see the King in our midst? As we navigate our faith journey, let us be people who not only know about God but truly know Him, who recognize His voice and respond with love, humility, and obedience.
