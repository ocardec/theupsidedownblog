## Trusting God from the Bottom of the Pit

![](images/thepit.webp){fig-align="center" width="400"}

Genesis 37:24 paints a vivid picture of despair: "And they took him and threw him into a pit. The pit was empty; there was no water in it." This verse captures a raw moment in Joseph’s life—betrayed by his own brothers and left in what seemed to be an inescapable situation. Yet, this pit was not the end of Joseph’s story; it was the beginning of God’s divine plan for his life. The lesson here is profound: trusting God is not just for the sunny days when life is smooth but especially for the dark, dry, and empty moments when nothing seems to make sense.

David captures this trust beautifully in Psalm 18:1–2, declaring, "I love you, O Lord, my strength. The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold." These words remind us of the unshakable foundation we have in God, even when our footing feels unsteady. Let’s explore how we trust God "from within and at the bottom of the pit" through the paradoxical truths of His upside-down Kingdom.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **The World vs. the Kingdom's Perspective**

From the world’s perspective, the pit could represent failure, abandonment, and hopelessness. It’s the place where dreams die, where human strength is insufficient, and where all resources seem depleted. The world teaches us that trust must be earned and that trust in God is only valid when we see tangible signs of His provision. If there’s no visible ladder out of the pit, the world says, “You’ve been forgotten.”

In contrast, the Kingdom of God transforms the meaning of the pit. What the world sees as abandonment, God uses as preparation. What feels like despair is an invitation to deeper trust. In the Kingdom, the pit is not the end but the soil where faith is cultivated. Consider Joseph: though his brothers intended harm, God was at work, orchestrating events for His glory and Joseph’s eventual good. The pit wasn’t the conclusion of Joseph’s story but the foundation of a testimony that would reveal God’s sovereignty and faithfulness.

This Kingdom perspective teaches us that God is not absent in the pit. He is present, actively working even when the walls of the pit seem to close in. Trusting God in the Kingdom means believing in His goodness and purposes, even when the world sees only despair.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **The Paradox Explained**

Trusting God from the bottom of the pit involves living out a paradox: delighting in the Lord when all you taste are tears, and finding hope in Him when circumstances appear hopeless. How do we reconcile these truths?

#### **God’s Sovereignty Is Our Security**

The first paradox is that the pit is never outside of God’s control. Joseph’s fall into the pit was not random; it was part of a divine plan to position him in Egypt, where he would eventually save countless lives during a famine. When we trust in God’s sovereignty, we see that even our darkest moments are under His rule. This doesn’t mean we won’t face pain, but it means our pain is purposeful. As David declared, “The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer” (Psalm 18:2). Even in the pit, God is immutable.

#### **Weakness Reveals God’s Strength**

The pit strips away self-reliance. Joseph, beloved by his father, learned in the pit that his earthly position could not save him. Similarly, our trials often remove the crutches of human comfort, forcing us to lean solely on God. This is where His power shines brightest: “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness” (2 Corinthians 12:9).

#### **God Redeems the Pit**

What seems like a place of despair becomes, in God’s hands, a place of transformation. Joseph’s journey from the pit to the palace illustrates this truth: God redeems what the enemy intends for harm. The ultimate example of this is the cross. What looked like defeat—a crucified Savior—became the ultimate victory over sin and death. Similarly, our pits can become platforms for God’s glory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Living the Paradox and Acting Accordingly**

To trust God in the pit, we must embrace the paradox by adopting a Kingdom mindset and living out our faith.

#### **Acknowledge the Pain Without Losing Hope**

Trust doesn’t deny reality. The pit is real, and the pain is valid. Pour out your heart to God, as David did in the Psalms, and confess your need for His help. But alongside your lament, cling to hope. God hears your cries and is near to the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18).

#### **Focus on God’s Character, Not the Circumstances**

It’s tempting to focus on the walls of the pit—our limitations, fears, and doubts. Instead, fix your eyes on God’s unchanging nature. He is faithful, good, and sovereign. Meditate on His promises in Scripture, like David’s declaration in Psalm 18:2. Trust grows when we remember who God is, even when we can’t see what He’s doing.

#### **Act in Faith, Not Fear**

Joseph didn’t know how his story would unfold, but he remained faithful to God in every season—whether in the pit, Potiphar’s house, or Pharaoh’s court. Trusting God in the pit means continuing to live out His calling, even when circumstances seem bleak. Pray, worship, and obey His Word, not because you feel like it but because He is worthy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Conclusion**

#### **Trusting God in the Pit Leads to Glory**

The pit is not the end; it’s a place where God’s faithfulness is revealed. Trusting Him at the bottom of the pit means believing that He is sovereign over our trials, that He is strong in our weakness, and that He redeems all things for His glory and our good. As David reminds us, God is our fortress, shield, and stronghold (Psalm 18:2). Trust Him, even when the pit feels dark and dry. For just as He raised Joseph from the pit to the palace, He is faithful to work all things for the good of those who love Him (Romans 8:28).
