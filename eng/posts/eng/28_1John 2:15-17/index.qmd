## Whoever Does the Will of God: The Upside-Down Kingdom Application – A Reflection on 1 John 2:15-17

![](../../img/rockypath.webp){fig-align="center" width="613"}

In life's journey, many people become distracted, wasting precious time by observing and admiring the stones and rocks along the path, losing sight of the ultimate destination. As in the above image, the contrast between a dark, winding trail through a foreboding forest and the brilliant light that beckons at its end serves as a vivid metaphor for our spiritual walk. While the path is filled with obstacles and allurements that can entangle the heart and divert attention, the true and perfect prize lies beyond — the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.

In 1 John 2:15-17, the apostle John issues a challenging command: “Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world. And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever.”

This passage unveils a fundamental aspect of the upside-down kingdom: in a world that values temporary pleasures, fleeting desires, and self-centered pride, God calls His people to live for what is eternal and unchanging. The true mark of those who belong to this kingdom is their commitment to doing the will of God, which stands in stark contrast to the values of the world and its distractions.

#### The World’s Perspective vs. the Kingdom’s Perspective

From a worldly perspective, life is often defined by the pursuit of what is immediately gratifying, pleasurable, and self-fulfilling. The world tells us to love and indulge in what we see, feel, and desire, promising happiness in the accumulation of wealth, status, power, and experiences. The mantra of the world is simple: "Follow your heart, pursue your dreams, and seize every opportunity to satisfy your cravings."

However, in the upside-down kingdom, the pursuit of these worldly desires is revealed to be both empty and temporary. John reminds us that "the world is passing away along with its desires" (1 John 2:17). What the world considers valuable and worth striving for is fleeting, subject to decay, and ultimately unable to satisfy the deepest longings of the human heart.

The Kingdom’s Perspective, on the other hand, teaches that true life is found not in satisfying the desires of the flesh, the eyes, or pride, but in doing the will of God. The values of the world and the values of God's kingdom are fundamentally opposed. While the world chases after what is temporary, the kingdom invites us to invest in what is eternal.

#### The Upside-Down Kingdom’s Perspective

**Love for God Over Love for the World:**

In the upside-down kingdom, love for God takes precedence over love for the world. To love the world is to be drawn away from the love of the Father. It is to invest our hearts, our energy, and our affections in what is passing away. But to love God is to align our lives with His purposes and to seek His will above all else. This kind of love is costly because it means saying no to the things the world esteems most highly—wealth, comfort, pleasure, and self-glorification—in order to say yes to God.

**Eternal Over Temporal:**

The upside-down kingdom calls us to prioritize the eternal over the temporal. The world tells us to grasp everything we can in this life because "you only live once." But the kingdom reminds us that this life is but a vapor, and the treasures we store up here will not last. Those who do the will of God understand that what is unseen is far more valuable than what is seen, and they live accordingly, investing in things that have eternal value—faith, hope, love, justice, mercy, and the gospel.

**The Will of God Over the Desires of the Flesh:**

The upside-down kingdom teaches that real life and fulfillment are found in doing the will of God, not in following the desires of the flesh. While the world glorifies self-gratification and self-promotion, God calls His people to deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow Him (Matthew 16:24). This means dying to our own desires, ambitions, and plans in order to live for God’s purposes. It is a call to obedience and faithfulness, even when it costs us comfort, status, or approval.

**Abiding Forever in Contrast to Passing Away:**

In God’s upside-down kingdom, those who do His will abide forever. This contrasts sharply with the world, which is passing away along with its desires. Those who align their lives with God’s eternal purposes find a lasting place in His story. Their work, their love, their sacrifice—none of it is wasted. They are not merely living for the present moment but for the eternal kingdom that will never fade.

#### Living Out the Principle

To live out the principle of 1 John 2:15-17 in the upside-down kingdom involves several practical steps:

-   **Examine Your Affections:** Regularly ask yourself, “What do I truly love? What am I truly living for?” Identify areas where your love for the world may be overshadowing your love for God, and ask the Holy Spirit to help you redirect your affections toward Him.

-   **Choose Eternal Investments:** Make decisions based on their eternal impact. Invest your time, energy, and resources in things that matter to God: building His kingdom, loving your neighbor, pursuing justice, sharing the gospel, and living a life of integrity and obedience to His Word.

-   **Reject Worldly Desires:** Resist the temptation to pursue the desires of the flesh, the desires of the eyes, and the pride of life. Instead, seek to cultivate a life marked by humility, generosity, purity, and a deep desire to honor God in all things.

-   **Commit to Obedience:** Make doing the will of God your highest priority. This may require sacrifice, but it is the path to true freedom, joy, and fulfillment. Remember that every act of obedience is a step toward eternity, where God’s purposes and promises are fully realized.

#### The Invitation to Practice

The invitation of 1 John 2:15-17 is both simple and profound: Will you choose to love God more than the world? Will you live for what is passing away or for what will last forever?

The upside-down kingdom invites you to find your life not in the pursuit of fleeting pleasures but in the pursuit of God's will. It calls you to let go of the temporal to gain the eternal, to love God above all else, and to rest in the assurance that whoever does the will of God will abide forever.

So, embrace the radical call of the upside-down kingdom today: Seek the eternal, prioritize God’s purposes, and let your heart be fully captivated by His love.
