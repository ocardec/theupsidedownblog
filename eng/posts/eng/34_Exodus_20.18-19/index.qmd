## **Listening God - A Reflection on Exodus 20:18-19**

![](../../img/sinai.webp){fig-align="center" width="613"}

> *"When the people saw the thunder and lightning and heard the trumpet and saw the mountain in smoke, they trembled with fear. They stayed at a distance and said to Moses, 'Speak to us yourself and we will listen. But do not have God speak to us or we will die.'" (Exodus 20:18-19)*

The Scriptures are filled with paradoxes that challenge our understanding, and the Gospel itself often feels like an upside-down reality. What seems impossible or even dangerous to the human mind becomes life-giving truth through the lens of God’s kingdom. One such paradox is the tension between the fear and beauty of hearing God's voice. The abovementioned Bible pasage provides a vivid scene of this tension. The Israelites, standing at the foot of Mount Sinai, are overwhelmed by God’s holiness and trembling at His voice. To them, hearing God seemed not only difficult but dangerous. They cry out to Moses:

*"You speak to us, and we will listen; but do not let God speak to us, lest we die.”* (Exodus 20:19, ESV)

To hear God’s voice felt terrifying—too holy, too pure, too overwhelming for sinful humanity to endure. And yet, as believers in Christ, we are called to *hear* God’s voice through Jesus, the Word of God made flesh.[^1] What the Israelites feared has now become our greatest source of life and hope. How do we reconcile this? Let’s explore this upside-down kingdom reality by unpacking it in three parts.

[^1]: 'And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. ' John 1:14 ESV <https://www.bible.com/bible/59/JHN.1.14>

#### **The World vs. the Kingdom’s Perspective**

From the world’s perspective, approaching the voice of God seems unthinkable. Holiness and human frailty clash, and the instinctive response is to retreat, much like the Israelites did. They recognized that standing in God’s presence could bring certain death. And they were right in a sense: God’s holiness exposes sin, and sinful man cannot stand before Him without consequence.[^2]

[^2]: And I said: “Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!” Isaiah 6:5 ESV <https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ISA.6.5>

This worldly logic suggests that the solution to this terror is distance—keeping God at arm’s length and allowing religious leaders or mediators to bear the brunt of God’s voice. Today, the world’s inclination is the same: avoid God’s truth and silence the divine voice wherever possible. Even within the church, there’s often a tendency to outsource our relationship with God to others—pastors, teachers, or programs—rather than personally drawing near to Him through His Word.

But the Kingdom’s perspective flips this logic on its head. What seems terrifying from a worldly view becomes, in Christ, the source of peace. The very holiness that once condemned now invites us to come closer. Jesus bridges the impossible gap, making it not only safe but essential for us to listen to God’s voice. In the kingdom of God, nearness to His Word is no longer a danger; it is our salvation.[^3]

[^3]: "Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost  those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them." Hebrews 7:25 ESV <https://www.bible.com/bible/59/HEB.7.25>

#### **The Paradox Explained**

At Sinai, the Israelites were right to fear for their lives. No one can hear from God directly and remain unchanged—or unjudged. Yet, through Christ, what was once a dangerous proposition is transformed into a life-giving reality. This is the paradox of the Gospel:

-   **God is too holy for sinners to approach**—yet Jesus, the Holy One, became sin for us (2 Corinthians 5:21).
-   **Hearing God’s voice feels overwhelming**—yet Jesus says, “My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me” (John 10:27).
-   **The Law reveals the judgment we deserve**—yet in Jesus, the Law is fulfilled, and we hear not condemnation but grace (Romans 8:1-2).

Through His life, death, and resurrection, Jesus has made it possible for us to hear God’s voice without fear of destruction. He is the better Mediator—one who doesn’t just deliver God’s Word to us but **is** the Word Himself. Christ brings us into relationship with the Father, making what was once impossible our daily privilege. The once-dangerous holiness of God now becomes the source of our deepest joy and transformation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Living the Paradox and Acting Accordingly**

To live in this paradox means reorienting our understanding and relationship with God’s Word and His voice. Instead of shrinking back in fear, we now approach boldly through Christ. Instead of relying on others to mediate God's Word to us, we immerse ourselves directly in Scripture, where God’s voice speaks clearly. Hebrews 10:19-22 encourages us to draw near with confidence because Jesus’ sacrifice has made:

> *"since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh, and since we have a great priest \[this is Jesus\] over the house of God, let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith..."*

When God speaks—whether through Scripture, prayer, or His Spirit—we can listen with boldness, trusting that we are fully accepted in Christ.

Living this way requires faith, because it still feels counterintuitive. The world around us insists that drawing near to God means losing our autonomy, surrendering our will, and being confronted with uncomfortable truths. And that’s exactly right—hearing from God does cost us something. But what we lose in self-rule, we gain in life everlasting. Jesus teaches that *dying to self* is the way to live, and *surrender* is the path to freedom.

When we embrace this paradox, it changes how we pray, read Scripture, and engage in the church. No longer do we avoid God’s commands or seek loopholes around His truth. Instead, we listen attentively, knowing that His voice—whether it convicts, comforts, or calls us to action—is always for our good.

Finally, living this paradox means we no longer fear what others might think if we stand firmly on God’s Word. The world may see listening to God as dangerous, foolish, or even offensive, but we know that the voice of our Shepherd is the way to eternal life. As Jesus said:

> *"It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is no help at all. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life."* (John 6:63, ESV)

#### **Conclusion**

The fear the Israelite felt at Sinai was real, and it reflected a right understanding of God's holiness. But in Christ, what was once a fearful separation has been transformed into intimate communion. Jesus makes it not only possible but necessary to listen to God. In Him, the voice that once terrified now draws us near with grace.

This is the upside-down kingdom of God: the holy voice that once condemned now speaks life. The law that once crushed us is fulfilled in Christ, and through Him, we hear the Father’s voice with joy. So let us no longer shrink back, but listen—truly listen—and follow the One who has made a way for us to hear.
