## Many Are Called, But Few Are Chosen: The Paradox of the Upside-Down Kingdom – A Reflection on Matthew 22:1-14

![](../../img/invitation.webp){fig-align="center" width="350"}

In Matthew 22:1-14, Jesus shares the Parable of the Wedding Feast, where a king invites many guests to the marriage celebration of his son. Despite the honor of being invited, many refuse to come, giving excuses or even mistreating the king’s messengers. In response, the king opens his banquet to anyone his servants can find, both “bad and good,” filling the hall with unexpected guests. Yet, when the king arrives, he notices one guest without wedding garments and has him cast out. Jesus concludes the parable with the powerful statement: “For many are called, but few are chosen” (Matthew 22:14).

#### The World’s Understanding vs. the Kingdom’s Reality

From a worldly perspective, the idea of "many are called, but few are chosen" seems unjust or exclusionary. The world values fairness based on human merit—what people deserve or earn based on their own actions or status. In such a worldview, an invitation to a royal banquet would be a matter of privilege, reserved for those who meet specific standards or who are deemed worthy. However, the upside-down kingdom of God operates on a different principle. In this parable, Jesus illustrates that the invitation to God's kingdom is extended to all, regardless of merit, status, or background. The kingdom is not about who we are or what we have done; it is about God’s sovereign grace and mercy. The many who are called represent the vast, indiscriminate reach of God's invitation to salvation. The banquet is prepared, and God eagerly invites everyone to come. Yet, not everyone responds with the humility and readiness required to enter.

#### The Paradox of Being Chosen

The paradox lies in the fact that while many are invited, only a few are chosen. In the upside-down kingdom, being "chosen" is not about status, wealth, or personal achievements; it is about the heart's response to God’s call. Those who are "chosen" are those who come on God's terms, not their own. The guest without the wedding garment represents those who attempt to enter God's kingdom on their own merits, without submitting to His righteousness.

The wedding garment symbolizes the righteousness of Christ, which believers must "wear" to be accepted by God. In the cultural context, guests at a royal banquet would often be provided with garments to wear, representing the king’s generosity. To refuse the garment would be an insult to the host. In the same way, to refuse the righteousness of Christ and try to stand before God on our terms is to miss the entire point of the gospel. The “few” who are chosen are those who humbly accept the garment provided by the king—those who put their faith in Christ and not in themselves.

#### The Upside-Down Kingdom’s Radical Invitation

In the upside-down kingdom, the invitation is wide, and the reach is far. God invites all—regardless of their past, their status, or their worthiness. This radical inclusivity is countercultural because it does not operate on the basis of human merit. Yet, the kingdom is also exclusive in a way that defies worldly logic: only those who come clothed in the righteousness of Christ are accepted. It is not about who is the most qualified but about who responds to God's invitation with humility and faith. This upside-down truth calls us to recognize our own neediness and dependence on God’s grace. It reminds us that we cannot enter the kingdom by our own efforts or merits; we must come on God’s terms, wearing the garment of grace that He provides through faith in Jesus Christ.

#### Living Out the Parable in the Upside-Down Kingdom

Living in light of this upside-down principle means acknowledging that our place in God's kingdom is a gift, not a reward. It means responding to God's invitation with gratitude, humility, and a readiness to embrace His righteousness rather than our own. It means living with a sense of awe at the inclusiveness of God's call while also recognizing the seriousness of responding rightly to that call. This truth challenges us to examine our hearts. Are we trying to stand before God in our own strength, or have we put on the wedding garment of Christ’s righteousness? It also calls us to extend the invitation to others, knowing that God desires all to come to repentance and to know Him (2 Peter 3:9).

#### Embracing the Call

The message of Matthew 22:1-14 is both sobering and hope-filled. Many are called, but few are chosen—yet, this is not a call to fear but a call to faith. It is an invitation to surrender our pride, our self-reliance, and our preconceptions about worthiness and to come to the feast humbly, joyfully accepting the grace offered by our King. In the upside-down kingdom, the last are first, the humble are exalted, and those who come to the feast wearing the garment of grace are welcomed into the joy of their Master. Let us respond to the call with hearts clothed in Christ, ready to partake in the banquet prepared for us.
