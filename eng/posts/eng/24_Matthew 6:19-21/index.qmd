## Treasures in Heaven: The Upside-Down Kingdom Application – A Reflection on Matthew 6:19-21

![](../../img/treasures.webp){fig-align="center" width="350"}

In Matthew 6:19-21, Jesus offers a radical perspective on what truly matters: “Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.”

This passage captures the essence of the upside-down kingdom: it challenges the world’s priorities and invites believers to find their true wealth not in the temporal, material possessions of earth, but in the eternal, spiritual riches of heaven.

#### The World’s Perspective vs. the Kingdom’s Perspective

In our world, treasures are typically defined by wealth, possessions, status, or achievements. Society encourages us to accumulate as much as possible, to find security in material abundance, and to gauge success by our level of comfort, power, or influence. The pursuit of earthly treasure is often driven by the desire for personal satisfaction, societal validation, and future security.

However, in the upside-down kingdom, Jesus subverts this idea by teaching that the real treasure is not found in earthly things but in heavenly realities. He challenges the common assumptions about value and success, calling His followers to store up treasures that are eternal, incorruptible, and aligned with God's purposes.

#### The Upside-Down Kingdom’s Perspective: Treasures That Truly Matter

1.  **Eternal Over Temporal:** The upside-down kingdom teaches that the most valuable treasures are those that cannot be seen with the physical eye. While the world urges us to build our lives around things that can be possessed, stored, or displayed, Jesus calls us to prioritize that which lasts beyond this life. Earthly treasures are temporary, subject to decay, theft, or loss. Heavenly treasures, on the other hand, are eternal—they are secure, enduring, and untouched by the forces of time and circumstance. This eternal perspective turns the world’s value system upside down, asking us to place our focus on what truly endures.

2.  **Heart Over Wealth:** Jesus’ teaching in Matthew 6:21 reveals a profound truth: "Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." The upside-down kingdom shows that our hearts follow our investments. If we place our treasures in earthly things—money, possessions, status—our hearts will be tethered to these temporary realities. But when we invest in heavenly treasures—faith, love, obedience, acts of mercy, generosity, and service to God—our hearts are drawn toward heaven. The call to lay up treasures in heaven is an invitation to align our hearts with God's purposes and to live with a deep love for what matters most to Him.

3.  **Giving Over Hoarding:** In the upside-down kingdom, storing up treasures in heaven often involves the act of giving rather than accumulating. Instead of hoarding wealth or resources for ourselves, Jesus encourages a life of radical generosity. Acts of kindness, compassion, and love—often at great personal cost—become deposits in our heavenly accounts. The more we give of ourselves, the more we reflect God’s heart and store up treasures that last. This goes against the grain of a world that says we must look out for ourselves first.

4.  **Kingdom Investments Over Earthly Gains:** To lay up treasures in heaven means to prioritize investments in the kingdom of God over earthly gains. It is to pour our time, talents, and resources into things that have eternal significance: sharing the gospel, discipling others, feeding the hungry, caring for the broken-hearted, defending the oppressed, and living in obedience to Christ. The upside-down kingdom teaches that every act done in Jesus’ name has lasting value, and nothing is wasted when it is done for His glory.

#### Living Out This Upside-Down Principle

To live according to Matthew 6:19-21 in the upside-down kingdom means embracing a different mindset in our daily lives:

-   **Assess What You Truly Value:** Take stock of what occupies your thoughts, your time, and your resources. Are they devoted to things that are passing away, or to things that will endure forever? This reflection helps us identify where our hearts truly lie.

-   **Prioritize Spiritual Over Material Wealth:** Make conscious choices to prioritize spiritual growth, character development, and relationships over material possessions. This might mean choosing to spend time in prayer and study rather than on entertainment, or investing in relationships that encourage spiritual growth over those that merely affirm worldly success.

-   **Practice Radical Generosity:** Regularly practice giving, not just of money, but of your time, talents, and resources. Look for opportunities to serve others, especially those in need, recognizing that these acts of love are treasures stored up in heaven.

-   **Stay Heavenly-Minded:** Cultivate a mindset that is fixed on eternal realities. This doesn’t mean neglecting earthly responsibilities but keeping them in proper perspective, remembering that our ultimate home is with God. Engage in daily practices like prayer, scripture reading, and meditation that help keep your focus on what truly matters.

#### The Invitation to True Wealth

In the end, Jesus’ call to store up treasures in heaven is an invitation to a life of deeper meaning, purpose, and joy. It is a call to invest in what cannot be stolen, to value what cannot perish, and to love what lasts forever. The world may call this foolishness, but in the upside-down kingdom, this is true wisdom.

By laying up treasures in heaven, we align ourselves with God’s heart, reflect His character, and prepare for an eternity in His presence. This perspective frees us from the anxiety and stress of trying to secure our future with earthly treasures and allows us to live with peace and purpose, knowing that our real treasure—and our real home—is with Him.

So, let us live with the vision of the upside-down kingdom, storing up treasures in heaven by loving God deeply, serving others faithfully, and seeking first His kingdom and righteousness (Matthew 6:33).
