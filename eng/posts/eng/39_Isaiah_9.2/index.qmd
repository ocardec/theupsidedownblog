## The Creator's Invitation to Witness His Glory in Jesus Christ

![](images/witness2.webp){fig-align="center" width="400"}

The prophet Isaiah declares a powerful truth about God’s initiative toward humanity:

*“The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone”* (Isaiah 9:2, ESV).

This passage beautifully captures God’s desire to reveal His glory to those lost in darkness. Throughout Scripture, God consistently invites us to witness His majesty, culminating in the person of Jesus Christ. From the brilliance of His transfiguration to the grace of His daily presence, we are privileged to experience the light of Christ and to bear that light to a darkened world. Understanding this invitation requires us to see the stark contrast between the world’s perspective and the reality of God’s kingdom, to grasp the paradox of His ways, and to live accordingly.

### The World vs. the Kingdom’s Perspective

In the world’s perspective, significance is often found in power, prestige, and the ability to control outcomes. Darkness, both spiritual and moral, clouds the world’s understanding. Many believe that glory is achieved through self-sufficiency, material wealth, and human achievement. Yet this pursuit of worldly light leaves people wandering aimlessly in deeper darkness. The world esteems those who seem to shine by their own efforts, but this light is fleeting and hollow.

In contrast, God’s kingdom operates with a radically different perspective. Isaiah 9:2 tells us that it is precisely *“the people who walked in darkness”* who receive the light of God. This light is not something we create or earn; it is something God graciously bestows. The Apostle John emphasizes this when he writes:

*“The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth”* (John 1:14, ESV).

God’s initiative to shine His glory upon us is an act of sheer grace. He enters our darkness and reveals His majesty in the person of Jesus Christ. This is not a glory of human achievement but a glory of divine presence—a glory we are invited to witness and experience firsthand.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The Paradox Explained

The paradox of God’s invitation is that His glory is often revealed in ways that defy human expectations. When Jesus invited His disciples to witness His majesty, He did so not through conquest but through moments of divine revelation. Consider the Transfiguration:

*“And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light”* (Matthew 17:2, ESV).

Peter, James, and John saw the divine radiance of Jesus—a glimpse of His eternal glory. This display of majesty was not for show or power but to confirm that Jesus is the Son of God, the fulfillment of all God’s promises. The paradox is that such divine glory was revealed through a humble teacher who would soon suffer and die for the sins of the world.

Similarly, Job’s experience captures this paradox. After enduring immense suffering, Job proclaims:

*“I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you”* (Job 42:5, ESV).

God’s glory was revealed to Job not in prosperity but in his weakness and dependence on God. This is the upside-down nature of God’s kingdom: His light shines most brilliantly where human pride and self-reliance are stripped away.

Thomas, who doubted Jesus’ resurrection, encountered this paradox when he saw the risen Christ and declared:

*“My Lord and my God!”* (John 20:28, ESV).

God’s invitation to witness His glory often comes in moments of vulnerability, doubt, and surrender. The paradox is that true sight and true light come not from our strength but from recognizing our need for God.

### Living the Paradox and Acting Accordingly

God’s invitation to witness His glory in Jesus Christ is not limited to the extraordinary events of Scripture. It is an invitation that extends to our daily lives. Today, we are called to live as those who have been shone upon by the light of Christ and to reflect that light to the world. Jesus said:

*“You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden”* (Matthew 5:14, ESV).

This is both a privilege and a calling. Because we have witnessed the glory of Christ, we are now commissioned to bear His light into the dark corners of our world. This means living lives marked by grace, truth, and humility. It means pointing others to the majesty of Christ through our actions, our words, and our character.

The Apostle Paul reminds us:

*“For God, who said, ‘Let light shine out of darkness,’ has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ”* (2 Corinthians 4:6, ESV).

Every believer has been illuminated by this light. Our lives are meant to be beacons, reflecting the glory we have received. We experience God’s majesty not only in moments of worship or spiritual insight but in the simple, everyday acts of faithfulness—serving others, extending grace, and proclaiming the truth of the gospel.

To live accordingly is to recognize that God’s glory is not something to hoard; it is something to share. Just as the disciples were privileged to see Jesus transfigured, we are privileged to know Him as the risen Lord. And just as God’s light shone upon those walking in darkness, we are called to let His light shine through us, illuminating the world with the hope and truth of Christ. May we embrace this calling daily, living as witnesses of the great light that has shone upon us in Jesus Christ.
