It challenges us to shift our focus from the temporal to the eternal, from the material to the spiritual, and from the fleeting to the everlasting.\n\n#### The World’s Perspective vs. the Kingdom’s Perspective\n\nThe world around us operates on the principle that “seeing is believing.” We are taught to trust what we can observe, measure, and analyze. Success is often judged by tangible outcomes—wealth, status, possessions, and achievements. The visible world, with all its allure and distractions, captures our attention and demands our focus.\n\nHowever, the upside-down kingdom of God calls us to a different kind of sight. Paul encourages us to fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. This is a profound shift in perspective, one that requires faith and spiritual discernment. It means valuing the eternal over the temporary, recognizing that the things of this world are passing away, while the things of God endure forever.\n\nIn God’s kingdom, the unseen realities—faith, hope, love, the presence of God, the promises of Scripture—are far more substantial and enduring than anything we can see with our physical eyes. The paradox is that true vision is not about what we can see with our eyes, but what we perceive with our hearts through faith.\n\n#### The Paradox of Fixing Our Eyes on the Unseen\n\nTo live with our eyes fixed on the unseen requires a radical reorientation of our values and priorities. It means learning to see with spiritual eyes, to discern God’s hand at work in ways that are not immediately obvious, and to trust in His promises even when circumstances seem contrary. It’s about living with an eternal perspective, where the trials and challenges of this life are viewed in light of the glory that awaits us.\n\nIn the upside-down kingdom, what the world deems as most important—material success, personal comfort, and outward appearances—are seen as fleeting and ultimately insignificant compared to the unseen realities of God’s kingdom. The world may consider this perspective foolish, but for believers, it is the key to enduring faith and hope.\n\nThis perspective allows us to endure hardships with patience and perseverance, knowing that our present sufferings are “not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us” (Romans 8:18). It enables us to invest in what truly matters—our relationship with God, the advancement of His kingdom, and the love we show to others—knowing that these things have eternal significance.\n\n#### Living with Eyes Fixed on the Unseen\n\nLiving with our eyes fixed on the unseen doesn’t mean ignoring the realities of the world around us. It means interpreting those realities through the lens of faith. It’s about seeing beyond the immediate to the eternal, understanding that our lives are part of a much bigger story that God is writing. This perspective brings purpose to our struggles, meaning to our sacrifices, and hope in the midst of suffering.\n\nPractically, this might mean prioritizing time in prayer and Scripture over the distractions of entertainment and media, choosing to invest in relationships rather than accumulating possessions, and making decisions based on eternal values rather than immediate gratification. It’s about cultivating a heart that longs for the things of God and is not swayed by the passing fads and values of the world.\n\n#### The Call to See with Spiritual Eyes\n\nPaul’s exhortation to fix our eyes on the unseen is a call to live in the reality of the upside-down kingdom, where what is unseen is more real and more valuable than what is seen. It’s a call to faith, to trust in the goodness and sovereignty of God, and to live with an eternal perspective.\n\nThis is the way of the cross—where Jesus, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame (Hebrews 12:2). Jesus saw beyond the immediate suffering to the eternal joy and victory that lay ahead. As His followers, we are called to do the same, to see beyond our present circumstances to the eternal glory that awaits us.\n\nIn the upside-down kingdom, seeing unseen things is not just a matter of faith—it is a matter of focus. It’s about choosing to look beyond the surface, to see the hand of God at work in every situation, and to live in light of the eternal realities that define who we are in Christ.\n\nAs we fix our eyes on the unseen, we find strength, hope, and peace that transcend the fleeting troubles of this life. We are reminded that what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal—and it is in the unseen that we find our true home and our ultimate hope.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Seeing Unseen Things: The Paradox of the Upside-Down Kingdom – A Reflection on 2 Corinthians 4:18\n\n![](../../img/seeUnseen.webp){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"350\"}\n\nIn 2 Corinthians 4:18, the Apostle Paul writes, “So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.” This verse invites us into the paradoxical reality of the upside-down kingdom, where true vision is not determined by what is visible, but by what is invisible.
