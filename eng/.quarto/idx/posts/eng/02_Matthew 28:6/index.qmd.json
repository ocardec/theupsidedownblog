([Matthew 28:6](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/mat.28.6){target=\"_blank\"}) captures this profound event: “He is not here, for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay.” In this single verse, the paradox at the heart of the upside-down kingdom is revealed: life comes from death. The very notion that death could produce life runs contrary to every natural instinct and worldly expectation. Yet, in God’s kingdom, the path to true life is through death—death to self, death to sin, and even, in Christ’s case, literal death.\n\n#### The World’s View of Life and Death\n\nIn the world’s view, death is final and must be avoided at all costs. It represents loss, despair, and the end of hope. Life, in contrast, is something to be clung to, pursued through self-preservation, and lived out in terms of worldly success, pleasure, and fulfillment. The idea that death could be a gateway to anything good—let alone the source of abundant, eternal life—is completely foreign to worldly thinking.\n\nYet, in the upside-down kingdom of God, the path to true and everlasting life is found precisely where the world sees only defeat. Christ’s resurrection defied all human expectations. The cross, a symbol of shame, suffering, and death, became the doorway to victory and life. The empty tomb is not merely a sign that Jesus lives—it is a declaration that through His death, all who trust in Him may live as well.\n\n#### The Paradox: Dying to Live\n\nThe upside-down kingdom is characterized by paradoxes that challenge our natural understanding. Jesus repeatedly taught that the way to gain your life is to lose it: “Whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it” ([Matthew 16:25](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/mat.16.25){target=\"_blank\"}). In the kingdom of God, true life is not found by clinging to the things of this world, but by dying to them. The call of discipleship is a call to take up our cross and follow Christ on a path of self-denial and sacrifice. But in this dying to self, we find something far greater—true and lasting life in Christ.\n\nThe resurrection is the ultimate proof of this paradox. What looked like the end—the death of the Son of God—became the beginning of new life for all who believe. Through His death and resurrection, Jesus opened the way for us to experience life that is eternal, filled with hope and joy, even in the face of suffering and death. This is the radical reversal at the heart of the gospel: death, the ultimate symbol of defeat, becomes the means of ultimate victory.\n\n#### Embracing the Paradox in Everyday Life\n\nThis paradoxical truth isn’t just a theological concept—it is the pattern for every believer’s life. The call to follow Christ is a call to daily die to our own desires, ambitions, and pride. It is in this dying that we are made alive in Christ. The Apostle Paul expresses this beautifully: “I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me” ([Galatians 2:20](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/gal.2.20){target=\"_blank\"}). In dying to ourselves, we find that we are alive in ways we never could have imagined. The life we gain is richer, deeper, and eternally secure.\n\nIn practical terms, this means that the more we surrender our lives to Christ—letting go of our need for control, reputation, and comfort—the more we experience the fullness of the life He offers. The world may see this as loss, but in God’s upside-down kingdom, it is the way to true gain. Whether it’s forgiving someone who has wronged us, giving generously to those in need, or choosing humility over self-promotion, these acts of dying to self are the seeds of life that bear fruit in God’s kingdom.\n\n#### The Resurrection: A Call to Live the Upside-Down Life\n\nThe resurrection is not just an event in history; it is the pattern for every believer’s life. Because Christ has conquered death, we no longer need to fear it. More than that, we are called to live out the paradox of life from death in our own lives. This is the great invitation of the upside-down kingdom: to find life by giving it up, to discover joy in the midst of sacrifice, and to experience true freedom in surrender.\n\nAs we reflect on the empty tomb and the risen Christ, let us remember that the path to life is not through clinging to our own way, but through surrendering it at the foot of the cross. In God’s kingdom, it is in dying that we truly live.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Life from Death: The Ultimate Paradox of the Upside-Down Kingdom – A Reflection on Matthew 28:6\n\n![](../../img/matt286.jpeg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"350\"}\n\nThe resurrection of Jesus Christ is the cornerstone of the Christian faith, a moment that declares victory over sin and death.
