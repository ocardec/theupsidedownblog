In this encounter, Jesus reveals that the way into the kingdom is radically different from the world’s way. It demands **surrender**, **humility**, and **dependence**, virtues that often seem backward to our natural instincts.\n\nThis passage invites us to examine the tension between the world’s perspective and God’s, the meaning behind the paradox, and how we are to live accordingly in light of it.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### The World vs. the Kingdom’s Perspective\n\nIn the world’s system, wealth and status signify success, security, and blessing. The rich young ruler embodied these ideals—morally upright, socially respected, and materially wealthy. He assumed that eternal life could be earned through his efforts, asking, “What do I still lack?” (v.20). His mindset reflects how the world operates: success comes through accumulation, achievement, and self-sufficiency.\n\nHowever, in the kingdom of God, the way to life is not through gaining more, but through giving up what holds our hearts captive. Jesus exposed the young man’s attachment to wealth, showing that his possessions were not merely blessings—they were barriers to following Christ. The world says strength and resources provide security, but Jesus warns that these very things can become obstacles to trusting God. His teaching astonished the disciples, revealing how deeply the world’s values had shaped even their thinking: \"Who then can be saved?\" they asked in disbelief.\n\n> The world says strength and resources provide security, but Jesus warns that these very things can become obstacles to trusting God\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### The Paradox Explained\n\nThe heart of the Gospel is a paradox: those who are “first” in the world—wealthy, powerful, and self-reliant—are at a spiritual disadvantage, while those who are “last”—weak, humble, and poor—are in a better position to receive grace. Jesus declares, “But many who are first will be last, and the last first” (v.30). Salvation cannot be achieved through human effort or status but is a gift that must be received with humility.\n\nJust as it is \"easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God\" (v.24), it is impossible for anyone to enter by their own strength. Jesus makes clear that salvation is possible only by God’s power, not human merit: \"With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible\" (v.26). Wealth, power, and self-reliance give a false sense of security, leading us to believe we can save ourselves. In contrast, those who recognize their need for God—those who are \"poor in spirit\" —are blessed because they rely fully on Him.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Living the Paradox\n\nTo follow Christ, we must adopt the kingdom's counterintuitive values. Jesus does not merely call for occasional sacrifice; *He calls for an entire reordering of our lives*. Peter, speaking for the disciples, asks, \"See, we have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?\" Jesus responds with a promise:\n\n> \"Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my name’s sake, will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life\" (v.29).\n\nLiving the paradox means holding worldly possessions and achievements with open hands, valuing eternal treasures over temporal ones. It means seeking first the kingdom of God, trusting that He will provide for our needs. It involves generosity with our resources, serving others, and finding joy not in personal gain but in living for Christ and others. As Paul writes, “I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord” (Philippians 3:8).\n\nFollowing Jesus often brings losses—whether material, relational, or personal—but these losses are insignificant compared to the surpassing reward of eternal life with Him. Christ’s call is to lose our lives in order to gain them. Living this way looks foolish to the world, but it reflects the wisdom of God, who exalts the humble and gives grace to those who know their need.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe paradox of the Gospel challenges our worldly assumptions: those who seem to have everything may be spiritually impoverished, while those who appear to have nothing are often the richest in faith. **Jesus calls us to live according to this upside-down kingdom, loosening our grip on wealth and status and trusting fully in Him.** In doing so, we find true life and lasting joy, knowing that \"many who are first will be last, and the last first\" (v.30).\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## What Do I Still Lack? – An Upside Down Kingdom Application on Matthew 19:23-30\n\n![](../../img/camel.webp){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"350\"}\n\nIn Matthew 19:23-30, Jesus confronts His disciples with a paradox that reveals the upside-down nature of God’s kingdom:\n\n> \"Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven\"\n\nThis declaration follows His encounter with the rich young ruler, a man who seemed to possess everything the world values—wealth, morality, and status—but who walked away sorrowful, unwilling to part with his riches to follow Christ.
