If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise. For the wisdom of this world is folly with God. For it is written, ‘He catches the wise in their craftiness.’” This passage presents a profound and challenging paradox that lies at the heart of the upside-down kingdom: to become truly wise, one must first become a fool.\n\n#### The World’s Wisdom vs. God’s Wisdom\n\nIn the eyes of the world, wisdom is associated with intellectual prowess, cleverness, and the ability to navigate life’s complexities in a way that brings success and admiration. The world esteems those who are shrewd, knowledgeable, and self-reliant—those who can achieve and maintain control through their own abilities and understanding.\n\nHowever, Paul turns this notion on its head. He warns that the wisdom of this world is ultimately folly in the sight of God. The wisdom that the world prizes so highly—focused on self-interest, pride, and human reasoning—leads to spiritual blindness and separation from God. It is a wisdom that exalts the self and dismisses the need for divine guidance, ultimately leading to destruction.\n\nIn contrast, the upside-down kingdom of God calls us to embrace what the world considers foolishness: the simplicity of the gospel, the humility of the cross, and the surrender of our own understanding to the wisdom of God. This is the paradox: to become wise in God’s eyes, we must be willing to become fools in the eyes of the world.\n\n#### The Paradox of Becoming Foolish to Gain Wisdom\n\nThe wisdom of the upside-down kingdom is rooted in the cross of Christ, which Paul elsewhere describes as “foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God” (1 Corinthians 1:18). The cross, a symbol of defeat and shame by worldly standards, is in fact the ultimate demonstration of God’s wisdom and power. It reveals that God’s ways are not our ways and that true wisdom is found in self-sacrifice, humility, and trust in God’s plan—even when it doesn’t make sense to human logic.\n\nFor believers, this means that becoming wise involves a radical reorientation of our values and priorities. It means rejecting the prideful wisdom that exalts human achievement and embracing the humility that recognizes our need for God. It means being willing to look like “fools” in the eyes of the world by placing our trust in the truths of Scripture, even when they contradict the prevailing cultural narratives.\n\nThis upside-down wisdom calls us to live in a way that defies conventional logic: to love our enemies, to forgive those who wrong us, to serve rather than be served, and to find strength in weakness. It challenges us to value what God values, even when it means being misunderstood or ridiculed by the world.\n\n#### Living Out the Upside-Down Wisdom\n\nTo live out this upside-down wisdom requires a daily commitment to following Christ’s example. It involves surrendering our own ambitions and desires in favor of God’s will, even when it seems counterintuitive. It means seeking God’s approval rather than the approval of others and being content with the knowledge that His ways are higher than our ways (Isaiah 55:9).\n\nThis kind of wisdom manifests in practical ways: choosing integrity over personal gain, embracing humility instead of self-promotion, and prioritizing relationships and service over status and wealth. It’s about trusting in God’s promises and holding fast to His truth, even when the world calls it foolish.\n\n#### The Call to Embrace the Foolishness of the Gospel\n\nUltimately, Paul’s exhortation to “become fools” is a call to embrace the foolishness of the gospel, which is the true wisdom of God. It’s a call to live in the upside-down kingdom where the last are first, the least are the greatest, and true wisdom is found in surrendering to Christ.\n\nIn God’s kingdom, the path to true wisdom is not through accumulating knowledge or mastering worldly strategies but through humbling ourselves before the cross and allowing God to transform our hearts and minds. It is through this transformation that we gain the wisdom that leads to eternal life—wisdom that the world may never understand, but which is precious in God’s sight.\n\nTo be wise by being fools means to live for the approval of our heavenly Father rather than the applause of the world. It means choosing the eternal over the temporal and the divine over the human. And in doing so, we find that the so-called “foolishness” of God is wiser than human wisdom and that His ways, though often mysterious, lead us into the fullness of life.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Becoming Wise by Being Fools: The Paradox of the Upside-Down Kingdom – A Reflection on 1 Corinthians 3:18-19\n\n![](../../img/wisefools.webp){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"350\"}\n\nIn 1 Corinthians 3:18-19, the Apostle Paul writes, “Let no one deceive himself.
