In the upside-down kingdom, the one who lowers himself the most is the one who is truly exalted.\n\n#### The World’s View of Power vs. The Kingdom’s View of Greatness\n\nThe world associates greatness with authority, leadership, and status. Climbing the ladder, having others serve your needs, and making a name for yourself are seen as indicators of success. Yet, in the kingdom of God, greatness is not about how high you can ascend, but how low you are willing to go. Jesus presents the paradox that true greatness is found not in ruling over others, but in humbly serving them.\n\nThe use of the word “slave” (Greek: *doulos*) in this passage is intentional and radical. A slave in Jesus’ time was someone with no rights, someone entirely at the disposal of others, existing solely to serve. By choosing this term, Jesus is not simply advocating for acts of service, but for a mindset of complete surrender, humility, and devotion to others, even at great personal cost. This is the essence of greatness in the upside-down kingdom: a willingness to become the least in order to reflect Christ.\n\n#### Christ: The Ultimate Example of Slavery for Greatness\n\nThe ultimate model of this upside-down principle is Jesus Himself. ([Philippians 2:7-8](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/php.2.7-8){target=\"_blank\"}) tells us that Christ “emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant \\[slave\\], being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.” Jesus, the King of kings, became a slave—not just in action but in identity—willingly lowering Himself for our sake.\n\nIn the eyes of the world, His path was one of weakness and failure. Yet, in God’s kingdom, it was the very path that led to ultimate exaltation: “Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name” ([Philippians 2:9](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/php.2.9){target=\"_blank\"}). In the same way, those who follow Christ’s example and embrace the role of a slave—seeking to serve rather than be served—are the ones who are considered truly great in the kingdom of God.\n\n#### The Paradox of Leadership Through Servanthood\n\nThe principle Jesus teaches is not just for those in positions of authority but is the standard for all who belong to His kingdom. Leadership in the upside-down kingdom is characterized by service, sacrifice, and humility. This is why Jesus says that to be first, we must become slaves. In God’s economy, the way up is down, and the way to be honored is to embrace the lowest place.\n\nIn practice, this means rejecting the world’s definitions of success and embracing a life where others’ needs come before our own. It means that greatness is not measured by the number of people under our influence, but by the number of people we serve. True spiritual leadership is not about being in the spotlight but about elevating others, even if it costs us our comfort, our reputation, or our resources.\n\n#### The Upside-Down Kingdom in Everyday Life\n\nApplying this upside-down principle in our daily lives challenges us to rethink our ambitions and redefine our goals. In a culture that tells us to assert ourselves and demand our rights, Jesus calls us to voluntarily lay them down. The greatest in the kingdom of God are those who embrace obscurity, who joyfully serve without seeking recognition, and who are willing to be last so that others might be first.\n\nThis doesn’t mean passivity or lack of ambition—it means redirecting our ambition toward God’s glory rather than our own. It’s a call to find contentment not in how much we can gain, but in how much we can give. When we serve as slaves for Christ, we reflect His heart to a world that desperately needs a different picture of greatness—one that points to the cross.\n\nIn the upside-down kingdom, the slave is the greatest because they embody the heart of Christ’s mission: to serve rather than to be served, and to give their life as a ransom for many ([Matthew 20:28](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/mat.20.28){target=\"_blank\"}). The true measure of greatness is not in how much power we accumulate, but in how faithfully we reflect the sacrificial love of our Savior.\n\nMay we embrace this countercultural path, joyfully taking the lowest place, knowing that in God’s kingdom, the last will be first, and the greatest are those who serve.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## The Slave is the Greatest: A Reflection on the Upside-Down Kingdom from Matthew 20:26\n\n![](../../img/service.jpeg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"350\"}\n\nIn ([Matthew 20:26](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/mat.20.26){target=\"_blank\"}), Jesus makes a shocking statement that challenges everything the world holds dear: “But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be your slave.” In a society where greatness is often equated with power, influence, and prestige, Jesus flips this idea on its head by defining true greatness as servanthood—specifically, the servanthood of a slave.
